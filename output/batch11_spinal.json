They reinforce the blood supply provided by these vertical descending arteries. The segmental spinal arteries themselves arise from intercostal arteries (thoracic region) or lumbar arteries (lumbar region)."

They enter via the intervertebral foramina along with spinal nerve roots and then divide into posterior and anterior radicular arteries."
