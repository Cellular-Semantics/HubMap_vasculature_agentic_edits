81	interlobular artery of pancreas	UBERON:0001637	artery	UBERON:0000916	abdomen	UBERON:8920020|UBERON:8920021|UBERON:8920022	dorsal pancreatic artery; greater pancreatic artery; caudal pancreatic artery	UBERON:0001264	pancreas	An artery that branches from the larger pancreatic arteries and courses between pancreatic lobules, giving rise to smaller intralobular branches and periductal branches that supply the pancreatic parenchyma and ducts.	Interlobular arteries are intermediate-sized vessels in the pancreatic microvasculature that run between (inter) pancreatic lobules. Based on the anatomical hierarchy, they branch from larger pancreatic arteries such as the dorsal pancreatic artery (UBERON:8920020), greater pancreatic artery (UBERON:8920021), or caudal pancreatic artery (UBERON:8920022). They are located in the abdomen (UBERON:0000916) and supply the pancreas (UBERON:0001264). These arteries give rise to smaller branches including lobular arteries and periductal branches.
103	lobular artery of pancreas	UBERON:0001637	artery	UBERON:0000916	abdomen		N/A	UBERON:0007324	pancreatic lobule	An artery that branches from the interlobular arteries of the pancreas and supplies individual pancreatic lobules, providing blood to the acinar tissue and islets of Langerhans within each lobule.	Lobular arteries are smaller vessels that branch from interlobular arteries and supply individual pancreatic lobules (UBERON:0007324). They represent the next level in the vascular hierarchy of the pancreas, distributing blood within the lobular structure to support the exocrine and endocrine functions of the pancreas. They are located in the abdomen (UBERON:0000916) and supply pancreatic lobules which contain both acinar tissue and islets of Langerhans.
125	periductal branch of interlobular artery of pancreas	UBERON:0001637	artery	UBERON:0000916	abdomen		N/A	UBERON:0007329	pancreatic duct	An artery that branches from the interlobular artery of the pancreas and supplies the pancreatic duct system, forming a periductal vascular plexus around the ductal epithelium.	Periductal branches arise from interlobular arteries and form a specialized vascular network around the pancreatic ducts (UBERON:0007329). This periductal plexus is essential for maintaining the health and function of the ductal epithelium, which transports exocrine secretions from the acinar tissue to the main pancreatic duct. These vessels are located in the abdomen (UBERON:0000916) and specifically supply the pancreatic duct system.
126	periductal branch of lobular artery of pancreas	UBERON:0001637	artery	UBERON:0000916	abdomen		N/A	UBERON:0007329	pancreatic duct	An artery that branches from the lobular artery of the pancreas and supplies the smaller intralobular and intercalated ducts within the pancreatic lobule, contributing to the periductal capillary network.	These are smaller periductal branches that arise from lobular arteries rather than interlobular arteries. They supply the finer branches of the pancreatic duct system within individual lobules, including intercalated ducts and smaller intralobular ducts (UBERON:0007329). These vessels form part of the microvascular network that ensures adequate perfusion of the ductal epithelium at the lobular level. They are located in the abdomen (UBERON:0000916).
162	transverse pancreatic artery	UBERON:0001637	artery	UBERON:0000916	abdomen	UBERON:8920020	dorsal pancreatic artery	UBERON:0001150|UBERON:0001151	body of pancreas; tail of pancreas	An artery that branches from the dorsal pancreatic artery and supplies the body and tail of the pancreas. It is also known as the inferior pancreatic artery.	The transverse pancreatic artery (also known as the inferior pancreatic artery) is a major branch of the dorsal pancreatic artery (UBERON:8920020). It runs transversely along the posterior aspect of the pancreas, supplying the body (UBERON:0001150) and tail (UBERON:0001151) of the pancreas. This entry was already documented in the template at row 37 (UBERON:8920023), so this represents verification of existing data. The artery is located in the abdomen (UBERON:0000916).
