    "paper_abstract": "The purpose of this work was to evaluate the sectorial and segmental arterial branching (second- and third-order branching) in the right and left hemilivers, as knowledge of this branching should lead to improved vascular mapping for various endovascular procedures in the liver. The study was conducted on 100 formalin-fixed adult cadaveric livers. The arterial anatomy of the liver was dissected from the origin of the hepatic arteries to their segmental branches. Conventional segmental branching of both the right and the left hepatic arteries was seen in only 25% of the livers. In the remaining livers, the segmental branching of one or both of the hepatic arteries was different from that given in anatomy texts. The branching of the right and left hepatic arteries was anatomically classified into seven and six patterns, respectively, mainly on the basis of their sectorial and segmental anatomy. The present study details the highly diverse segmental arterial anatomy of the liver. The information provided here has important implications for procedures that involve selective catheterization of segmental arteries."
